Music Player
============
This project is basically an excuse to keep myself busy; I am coding a
simple music player in Java. I can use the music API already, and it will
be fun to extend that.

Goals
-----
Initially, I will be happy if the thing plays a song and looks pretty :).
My final iteration should have:

1. Music playback (Pause, play, seeking).
`Music playback is now partially implemented; a user can start and pause a song`
1. Some form of visualisation, so that it's not just a boring screen.
However, the option of an unobtrusive music bar in the corner of a screen
will be desired as well.
`Currently we are a small window in the root pane of the window`
1. Playlist support. I want to be able to read and write playlists of music,
the format of which is still to be determined.
1. Support for album, artist tags etc.
